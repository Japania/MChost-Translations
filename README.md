# MChost Translations
Want to help us translate our website in your own language?

Copy the default template for any file that you speak and create a pull request after you translate it.

The format for the name of the file is `language.js` where *language* is the common name of the language in English, lowercase. On line 2 (`en: {`) change `en` with the short code of the language (e.g. en, de, es, etc.)

If you find an incorrect translation, fork the file and make a pull request.
